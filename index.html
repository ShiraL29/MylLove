            <i>I do not love you as if you were salt-rose, or topaz,<br>
            or the arrow of carnations the fire shoot off.<br>
            <b>I love you</b> as certain dark things are to be loved,<br>
            in secret, between the shadow and the soul.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>I love you</b> as the plant that never blooms<br>
            but carries in itself the light of hidden flowers;<br>
            thanks to your love a certain solid fragrance,<br>
            risen from the Earth, lives darkly in my body.<br>
        </p>
        <p><b>I love you</b> without knowing how, or when, or from where.<br>
            <b>I love you</b> straightforwardly, without complexities or pride;<br>
            so <b>I love you</b> because I know no other way than this:<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Where I does not exist, nor you,<br>
            so close that your hand on my chest is my hand,<br>
            so close that your eyes close as I fall asleep.<br></i><hr>
